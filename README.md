# Firebase Authorisation

## About The Project

This project was used to understand how to bake the functionality of Google Firebase into an application for user authentication.

Firebase Authentication can be used to allow users to authenticate, using both an email address and a password.

This basic application uses a series of activities to allow a user to enter their email address and password, which in turn provides authentication.

The Firebase API also provides the additional functionality of handling user logout, together with password reset. Both of these features were used.
